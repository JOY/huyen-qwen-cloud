## Judging Criteria Response

### Technical Depth and Engineering

Huyen uses Qwen Cloud through an OpenAI-compatible live adapter and keeps a synthetic fallback so the public repository is buildable without secrets. The DOSClaw/OpenClaw integration path supports opt-in Qwen Cloud provider injection, primary model selection, and MCP tool evidence for memory, knowledge, and handoff flows.

Evidence:

- `src/lib/qwen.ts`
- `src/app/api/demo/route.ts`
- `docs/huyen-agent-config.md`
- `scripts/smoke-scenarios.ps1`

### Innovation and AI Creativity

The project is positioned as a production SME support autopilot rather than a generic chatbot. It combines persistent memory, live knowledge lookup, and honest escalation into one focused business workflow.

Evidence:

- `docs/demo-script.md`
- `docs/video-recording-packet.md`
- `docs/architecture.mmd`
- `README.md`

### Problem Value and Impact

Vietnamese SMEs often run customer support through chat channels with informal staff handoff. Huyen addresses three concrete failure modes: forgetting repeat customers, guessing policy facts, and falsely claiming staff escalation.

Evidence:

- `docs/devpost-draft.md`
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `scripts/smoke-scenarios.ps1`

### Presentation and Documentation

The public repo includes a clean README, architecture diagram, Devpost draft, demo script, deployment runbook, proof checklist, RAM policy template, and evidence package generator.

Evidence:

- `README.md`
- `docs/deployment-proof.md`
- `docs/alibaba-cloud-deploy.md`
- `scripts/package-submission.ps1`

## Current Blocking Item

Alibaba Cloud deployment is blocked by RAM permissions for user `joy` in `ap-southeast-1`.

Required unlock:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/preflight-alibaba.ps1
```

The preflight must pass before image push or runtime creation. Use `docs/alibaba-ram-policy-huyen-deploy.json` as the policy template.
